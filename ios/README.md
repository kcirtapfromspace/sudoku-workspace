# Sudoku iOS App

A native iOS Sudoku app powered by the Rust `sudoku-core` engine.

## Requirements

- Xcode 15.0+
- iOS 16.0+ deployment target
- Rust toolchain (for building the engine)
- [xcodegen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) (for generating Xcode project)

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install Rust (if not already installed)
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Install xcodegen
brew install xcodegen

# Add iOS targets
rustup target add aarch64-apple-ios aarch64-apple-ios-sim x86_64-apple-ios
```

### 2. Build the Project

```bash
# From the workspace root
cd ios
./build.sh
```

This will:
- Build the Rust library for iOS device and simulator
- Generate Swift bindings via UniFFI
- Create an XCFramework
- Generate the Xcode project

### 3. Open in Xcode

```bash
open Sudoku/Sudoku.xcodeproj
```

Or generate the project manually:

```bash
cd Sudoku
xcodegen generate
open Sudoku.xcodeproj
```

## Puzzle Generation (Rust)

When you start a new game, the iOS app asks the Rust engine to generate a brand-new Sudoku puzzle for the selected difficulty.

The call chain looks like this:

- Swift: `GameManager.newGame(...)` -> `PuzzleCache.shared.getPuzzle(...)`
- Swift -> Rust (UniFFI): `SudokuGame.newClassic(difficulty: ...)`
- Rust: `SudokuGame::new_classic` calls `sudoku_core::Generator::generate(...)` and then solves it with `sudoku_core::Solver`

### How the Generator Picks a Puzzle

The generator lives in `crates/sudoku-core/src/generator.rs` and works in three phases:

1. Generate a full valid solution grid
   - Start with an empty classic 9x9 grid.
   - Randomly fill the 3 diagonal 3x3 boxes (they don't constrain each other).
   - Use the solver to complete the rest of the grid.

2. Remove givens while keeping a unique solution
   - Shuffle all 81 positions.
   - Remove values in symmetric pairs (default is 180-degree rotational symmetry; `Extreme` uses no symmetry).
   - After each removal, the solver checks that the puzzle still has exactly one solution.

3. Rate difficulty and accept/retry
   - The solver runs `rate_difficulty` (in `crates/sudoku-core/src/solver.rs`) by applying human-style techniques in order.
   - The generator accepts puzzles that match the target difficulty (sometimes within one adjacent tier) and that land in a givens range for that difficulty.
   - It will retry up to `max_attempts` for that difficulty before falling back to the last attempt.

### Why the Engine Also Computes the Solution

In `crates/sudoku-ffi/src/lib.rs`, `SudokuGame::new_classic` generates the puzzle grid and also solves it immediately. The solved grid is used to:

- validate player moves (for mistake counting)
- generate hints
- support fast checks like "is this puzzle complete?"

Example usage with Rust engine:

```swift
import SudokuEngine

// Create a new game
let game = SudokuGame.newClassic(difficulty: .medium)

// Make a move
let result = game.makeMove(row: 0, col: 0, value: 5)

// Get hint
if let hint = game.getHint() {
    print("Hint: \(hint.explanation)")
}
```

## Development Notes

### Rebuilding Rust vs Iterating on SwiftUI

Run `./build.sh` when you change Rust code or the UniFFI interface. If you're only changing SwiftUI/view code, you can usually just build/run from Xcode without regenerating bindings.

### Building for Release

For App Store submission, ensure you:
1. Build the Rust library in release mode
2. Set your development team in Xcode
3. Configure App Store Connect for Game Center and iCloud
